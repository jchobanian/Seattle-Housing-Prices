# Seattle-Housing-Prices
an investigation into the housing market of King County using machine learning algorithms

For this project I used Python 3.0 and the following libraries:

Numpy for linear algebra

Pandas for data processing

math for some feature engineering

Matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn for data visualization

Machine learning models from Sklearn: LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier

XGBoost as my final machine learning model

Evaluation models from Sklearn Cross_val_score, GridSearchCV
